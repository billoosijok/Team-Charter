						<h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
						<p>
							This team has been formed to bring Fire District 6's website up to date and change platforms. The client would like this new website to be a great resource for the community and not just remain a static site that no one visits.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="analysis">
						<h3>Analysis</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Strengths:</strong> Our personalities mesh well and we get along great. Our skill sets vary with very small overlap so each team member will bring something to the group that will help the others grow.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Skills to be developed:</strong> As a team we are planning on developing our experience in real-life projects, which involves learning about group file-management, evenly dividing the workload, and making sure everybody is on track.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="meeting">
						<h3>Meeting Structure</h3>
						<p>
							Official team meetings/check-ins will occur every Monday and Friday at 1pm. The Project Manager will have the agenda ready for items that need to be discussed and checked off from the Project Plan.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="communication">
						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p>
							Communication via slack and shared documents in a shared google drive folder and eventually GitHub.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="decsision">
						<h3>Decsision Process</h3>
						<p>
							Gather ideas from the group during team meetings, then assessing which path makes more sense for the project's goal while also accounting for our timeline. If we are unable to reach a consensus within the group, the Project Manager/Lead will make the final decision.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="expectations">
						<h3>Team Member Expectations</h3>
						<p>
							All team members are expected to participate, share opinions and ideas, and respect each other during the entire process from start to finish. We discussed our schedules/obligations outside of class time and will schedule meetings when all members are available.
							Non-performing team members will need to speak to the team lead and explain any challenges they are having to prevent the team from falling behind. If a team member is unable to complete a task, we will discuss as a team and redistribute the task if necessary to make sure we stay on track and on time.

						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="assessment">
						<h3>Assessment</h3>
						<p>
							We will be filling out Team Evaluations at the end of this project so each member knows these evaluations are a big part of our grade (300 points). Each member's effectiveness will be assessed by how well they worked within the group and willingness to put in their fair share of the work.
