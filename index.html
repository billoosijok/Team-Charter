						</ul>
						<li id="purpose_statement">
							<h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
							<p>This team has been formed for several projects including updating the Fire District #6’s website  and change platforms. The client would like this new website to be a great resource for the community and not just remain a static site that no one visits.  We are also together to complete two skill building exercises that will help prepare us for our project with fire district #6.  We hope that these exercises will help us figure out what roles we are comfortable working in, and help us with communicating as a team.  Our objective is to use the skill building exercises to create a systematic approach to our final project. </p>
						</li>
						<li id="analysis">
							<h3>Analysis</h3>
							<h4>Strengths:</h4>
							<p>Most of the team members have great foundation in HTML and CSS and a couple members even have more advanced programming and design skills. Those that don’t have the advanced skills in these areas are totally willing to jump in and learn what they need to to assist the team in meeting deadlines. Our team has a lot of opinions and suggestions on how the project should flow which could sometimes be a weakness but is something a team definitely needs; opinions and suggestions. We also have someone with project management experience which will help keep the team organized and accountable</p>
							<h4>What needs to be developed?:</h4>
							<p>
								As a team we are planning on developing our experience in real-life projects, which involves learning about group file-management, evenly dividing the workload, and making sure everybody is on track.  As a team we plan on taking advantage of tools like git in order to manage our website's files and track the progress of development.  We are also using google drive to store our reference materials. Personally, we need to make sure we continue to respect each other’s input and know how to properly respond when something doesn’t go our way. For example, if an idea of mine doesn’t get implemented because the rest of the group strongly feels we should go in another direction, I need to accept that and move on to the next task.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li id="meeting_structure">
							<h3>Meeting Structure</h3>
							<p>Our “in person” meetings outside of class will be held on monday afternoons at 1pm so that we have the opportunity to plan the objectives of the week.  The project manager is expected to have an agenda ready by at least the night before.  We plan on structuring the meetings with the opening consisting of each member discussing what they have been working on since the last class and discussing any obstacles they’ve experienced.  Attendance is required at all meetings. In the case of emergency or bad weather, each member needs to advise the team via Slack so we can either schedule a different time or they can provide their updates to the team lead so they can share during the meeting.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="communication">
							<h3>Communication</h3>
							<p>Communication via slack and shared documents in a shared google drive folder and eventually GitHub. We will also have time in class and our official weekly meeting to make sure we are all in sink.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="decision_making">
							<h3>Decision Making Process</h3>
							<p>Gather ideas from the group during team meetings, then assessing which path makes more sense for the project's goal while also accounting for our timeline. If we are unable to reach a consensus within the group, the Project Manager/Lead will make the final decision. Besides the Project Manager/Team Lead, there will also be a Developer, Design, and UX lead. They will be responsible for their part, again after hearing feedback from the team. We are tracking our team's progress through a project plan that is in the form of a spreadsheet. We are also creating a planning slack channel where our project manager can send us meeting recaps and notify of of impending deadlines.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="Expectations">
							<h3>Expectations</h3>
							<p>All team members are expected to participate, share opinions and ideas, and respect each other during the entire process from start to finish. We discussed our schedules/obligations outside of class time and will schedule meetings when all members are available. Non-performing team members will need to speak to the team lead and explain any challenges they are having to prevent the team from falling behind. If a team member is unable to complete a task, we will discuss as a team and redistribute the task if necessary to make sure we stay on track and on time. We are talking about implementing a point system where we all start off with the same amount of points and if we do not complete our task, points will be deducted which then will be noted in the team assessment at the end and during the course of the class.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="assessment">
							<h3>Assessment</h3>
							<p>We will be filling out Team Evaluations at the end of this project so each member knows these evaluations are a big part of our grade (300 points). Each member’s effectiveness will be assessed by how well they worked within the group and willingness to put in their fair share of the work.  In addition to our team assessment for our final project, our weekly meetings will be an important part in assessing our team's effectiveness.  These meetings will be an opportunity for us to discuss what went well and where we need to improve. We have already used our first meeting for responding to the feedback we received on this assignment. </p>
